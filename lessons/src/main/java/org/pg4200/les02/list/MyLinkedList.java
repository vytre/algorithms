        If we delete the first element, the list is very quick, whereas with
        array we need to shift left the entire collection.
        On the other hand, if we delete the last, there is no shift with array,
        but in list we need to traverse the entire collection, even if we do
        actually have a pointer to "tail".

                We do not have B if we stop at A. But B can be read by simply
                noticing that B == A.next.
                Therefore, we can iterate with a "previous" variable until we reach
