        Here, we shouldn't just extend MyArrayList.
        It would work, but it would be very inefficient, as each
        dequeue operation would always force a full left-shift of the whole
        array-list (recall that a dequeue would be equivalent to a delete at
        index 0 in the array-list).

        When the queue is empty, we need that the "head"
        and "tail" represent invalid values.
        If they were objects, we could use "null".
        But if we use "int", then we need to use something
        equivalent to "null", as primitive values (int, double,
        boolean, etc.) do not have null.
        So, an option is  to just represent invalid values with
        negative int, because anyway negative values would never
        be valid indices in an array.

        Note: another option would be to use Integer instead of int,
        as being an object it has null. However, being Integer just
        a wrapper around int, using them as indices would not
        be efficient.
