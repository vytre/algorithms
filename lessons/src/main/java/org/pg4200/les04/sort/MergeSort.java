        /*
            Here we create a buffer as a local variable, and pass it
            around at each recursive mergesort(...) call.
            It might be tempting to rather put it in a field, eg
            "private T[] buffer;"
            to avoid having to pass it around at each call.
            However, that would not be "thread-safe", ie two (or more)
            threads trying to sort different arrays at the same time using
            the same MergeSort object would
            end-up overriding such same buffer, leading to bugs.
            Multi-threading is something we do not see in details in this
            course, though.
            Furthermore, you should consider that usually a sorting algorithm
            would not need for an object instance, and so could be in a "static"
            method. Here we use regular methods to be able to ovverride from an
            interface (so we can re-use the same test cases for all the different
            implementations of MySort; recall you cannot override static methods).
            When using static methods, could still have something like:
            "private static T[] buffer;"
            which would lead to those mentioned multi-threading issues.

            Note that, besides the "buffer" array, also the input "array" array
            could be saved in a private field. But that would lead to exactly the
            same problem with multi-threading.
